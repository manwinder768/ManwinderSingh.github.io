            In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with an elongated stem, or trunk, supporting branches and leaves in
            most species. In some usages, the definition of a tree may be narrower, including only woody plants with
            secondary growth, plants that are usable as lumber or plants above a specified height. In wider definitions,
            the taller palms, tree ferns, bananas, and bamboos are also trees. Trees are not a taxonomic group but
            include a variety of plant species that have independently evolved a trunk and branches as a way to tower
            above other plants to compete for sunlight. Trees tend to be long-lived, some reaching several thousand
            years old. Trees have been in existence for 370 million years. It is estimated that there are just over 3
            trillion mature trees in the world.[1]

            A tree typically has many secondary branches supported clear of the ground by the trunk. This trunk
            typically contains woody tissue for strength, and vascular tissue to carry materials from one part of the
            tree to another. For most trees it is surrounded by a layer of bark which serves as a protective barrier.
            Below the ground, the roots branch and spread out widely; they serve to anchor the tree and extract moisture
            and nutrients from the soil. Above ground, the branches divide into smaller branches and shoots. The shoots
            typically bear leaves, which capture light energy and convert it into sugars by photosynthesis, providing
            the food for the tree's growth and development.
