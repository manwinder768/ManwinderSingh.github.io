                The bird is a flying feathered creature, with two strong wings and two legs. It can fly in the sky and travel long distances in the air. It builds nest on the trees, and eats insects, fish, grains, etc. Some of the birds have a crest on their forehead. Its tail helps it to keep balance in the air, and the two legs for hopping. It lays eggs, and hatches the young ones. There are migratory birds which fly from one country to another over the hills, lakes and oceans during some particular season. There are various species of birds, some smaller and some bigger in size. They are of various colours. The tiny birds fly in flocks. The bigger size birds like eagle or the long necked cranes are fond of fish. They are seen generally near the rivers or marshy lands, waiting to catch fish. The vultures are fond of flesh of dead animals. The owls can see even in darkness. The bats hang from the branches of trees upside down. The bats are actually mammals and not birds, although they resemble birds. Some of the beautiful birds are trained in cages by men.
