            Birds, also known as Aves or avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by
            feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered
            heart, and a strong yet lightweight skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the 5 cm (2 in)
            bee hummingbird to the 2.75 m (9 ft) ostrich. They rank as the world's most numerically successful class of
            tetrapods, with approximately ten thousand living species,[3] more than half of these being passerine, or
            "perching" birds. Birds have wings whose development varies according to species; the only known groups
            without wings are the extinct moa and elephant birds. Wings, which evolved from forelimbs, gave birds the
            ability to fly, although further evolution has led to the loss of flight in some birds, including ratites,
            penguins, and diverse endemic island species of birds. The digestive and respiratory systems of birds are
            also uniquely adapted for flight. Some bird species of aquatic environments, particularly seabirds and some
            waterbirds, have further evolved for swimming.
