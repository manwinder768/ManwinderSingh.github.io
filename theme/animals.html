            Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few
            exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and
            grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living
            animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are
            over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6
            metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate
            food webs. The kingdom Animalia includes humans, but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to
            non-human animals. The study of non-human animals is known as zoology.
