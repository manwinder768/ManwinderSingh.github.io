    <p>Nature is that natural and physical world that surrounds us and makes life possible on earth. Nature is the heart of earth. Nature heals us and helps build connection with our freedom, authenticity and our souls. Simply connecting and feeling nature gives us a divine pleasure. We have a strong bond and emotional connection with nature. The serenity of nature calms our hearts. The stillness and movement in nature both have a hypnotizing effect. The unfolding creativity of nature is an art. It is alluring to experience solitude with nature. The practice of devoting ourselves to the bliss of nature is soothing and reviving. Everyone loves to escape away in the mysteries of nature.</p>
