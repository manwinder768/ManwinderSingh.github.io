        <p>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, or material world or universe. "Nature" can refer to
            the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the
            only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate
            category from other natural phenomena.

            The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential qualities, innate disposition", and in
            ancient times, literally meant "birth".[1] Natura is a Latin translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις),
            which originally related to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other features of the
            world develop of their own accord.[2][3] The concept of nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of
            several expansions of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the word φύσις by
            pre-Socratic philosophers, and has steadily gained currency ever since. This usage continued during the
            advent of modern scientific method in the last several centuries.[4][5]

            Within the various uses of the word today, "nature" often refers to geology and wildlife. Nature can refer
            to the general realm of living plants and animals, and in some cases to the processes associated with
            inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord, such as the
            weather and geology of the Earth.</p>
