            The Earth's atmosphere is a key factor in sustaining the ecosystem. The thin layer of gases that envelops
            the Earth is held in place by gravity. Air is mostly nitrogen, oxygen, water vapor, with much smaller
            amounts of carbon dioxide, argon, etc. The atmospheric pressure declines steadily with altitude. The ozone
            layer plays an important role in depleting the amount of ultraviolet (UV) radiation that reaches the
            surface. As DNA is readily damaged by UV light, this serves to protect life at the surface. The atmosphere
            also retains heat during the night, thereby reducing the daily temperature extremes.

            Terrestrial weather occurs almost exclusively in the lower part of the atmosphere, and serves as a
            convective system for redistributing heat.[25] Ocean currents are another important factor in determining
            climate, particularly the major underwater thermohaline circulation which distributes heat energy from the
            equatorial oceans to the polar regions. These currents help to moderate the differences in temperature
            between winter and summer in the temperate zones. Also, without the redistributions of heat energy by the
            ocean currents and atmosphere, the tropics would be much hotter, and the polar regions much colder.</p>
